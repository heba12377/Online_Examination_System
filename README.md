# Online Examination Systems

In this Project, we aim to create an Examination System that generates random questions for students by creating our own Data Base, choosing our entities, their properties, and the relations between them, using SQL Server as our relational database management system.


## Introduction
Our system consists of some students who are enrolled in a number of departments and take many courses with different topics. There are some instructors who teach these courses and have Evaluations. Our Exam contains some random questions that have two types, the first one is multiple-choice questions and the second one is True/False questions. Each course has a number of exams to evaluate every student using our exam correction system that enables students to get their grades in each course they are enrolled in.
