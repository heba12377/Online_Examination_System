# Online Examination Systems(SQL)

In this Project, we aim to create an Examination System that generates random questions for students by creating our own Data Base, choosing our entities, their properties, and the relations between them, using SQL Server as our relational database management system.

## Introduction

Our system consists of some students who are enrolled in a number of departments and take many courses with different topics. There are some instructors who teach these courses and have Evaluations. Our Exam contains some random questions that have two types, the first one is multiple-choice questions and the second one is True/False questions. Each course has a number of exams to evaluate every student using our exam correction system that enables students to get their grades in each course they are enrolled in. 

## Features

We have implemented Examination system which includes.

- Procedures for CRUD operations for all entities
-  Procedures for the Exam Generation, Answers, and Correction

- Procedure that returns the studentâ€™s information according to Department Id that the student is enrolled. 
- Procedure that takes the student ID and returns the grades of the student in all courses. 
- Procedure that takes the instructor ID and returns the name of the courses that he teaches and the number of students per course. 
- Procedure that takes course ID and returns its topics   
- Procedure that takes exam number and returns the Questions in it and its choices. 
- Procedure that takes exam number and the student ID then returns the Questions in this exam with the student answers
